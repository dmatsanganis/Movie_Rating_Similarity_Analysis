    "### Assignment 1: User Similarity using Jaccard Distance, Min Hashing, and LSH\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the use of Jaccard distance, min hashing, and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in the context of user similarity in a movie rating dataset. The dataset used for this assignment contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. We will perform various tasks to compute user similarity and evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. The tasks include importing and pre-processing the dataset, computing the exact Jaccard similarity of users, computing similarity using Min-hash signatures, and locating similar users using LSH index.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current analysis will be done on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and in [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).\n",

    "For this assignment, we will focus on the set of movies that each user has rated and not the actual ratings. We will preprocess the dataset by extracting the movie IDs for each user and organizing the data in a suitable format for further analysis. Any necessary conversions or processing steps will be described in detail, along with the reasons behind them.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "For **50** hash functions the average false positives are relatively **high at 204.4**, indicating that there is a significant number of pairs of users that have a high estimated similarity but a low exact Jaccard similarity. This suggests that the Min-hash signatures with 50 hash functions **may not be very accurate in capturing the true similarity between users**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average false negatives are significantly low at **1.8**, indicating that the Min-hash signatures are generally effective in capturing the cases where users have a low estimated similarity but a high exact Jaccard similarity. The false negatives suggest that the Min-hash signatures perform well in identifying dissimilar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we elevate the number of hash functions to **100**, the average false positives **decrease significantly to 36.4 compared to 50 hash functions**. This indicates an improvement in accurately identifying pairs of users with high estimated similarity and low exact Jaccard similarity.\n",
    "The average false negatives **slightly rises to 2.0**, indicating that this non-substantial difference does not imply that the increase in the min hash signatures length deteriorates the non-idetifiable user pairs and consequently the amelioration in the the false pocitive incidents is a far more important improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when we set the number of hash functions to **200**, the average false positives further **decrease to 10.0, suggesting a higher accuracy in identifying pairs of users with high estimated similarity but low exact Jaccard similarity compared to 100 hash functions**.\n",
    "The average false negatives **slightly rises again to 2.2**, indicating that the Min-hash signatures continue to perform well in capturing cases of low estimated similarity but high exact Jaccard similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **increasing the number of hash functions from 50 to 200 leads to a reduction in false positives and to a non-substantial increase to false negatives that should not be taken into consideration as it is below one pair increase on average, resulting in more accurate similarity estimation overall using Min-hash signatures**. A larger number of hash functions provides finer-grained hashing and improves the precision of similarity estimation. However, it's important to *strike a balance as increasing the number of hash functions also increases the computational cost*. Therefore, choosing an appropriate number of hash functions requires considering the *trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, depending on the computation cost the 100 hash functions choice is probably the best one. However, we do not have any particular information and timewise demand so, the comparison lead to the same results, therefore we cannot select the optimum between the two, so we assume that the best one is the more efficient one - at least resultwise - so it is the solution containing the 200 hash functions."

    "- LSH instance 2 with b = 40 and r = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using each LSH instance, we will locate pairs of users that share at least one identical band. These pairs present a high probabity of presenting similarity in a great extent. In the next step the range of the aforementioned user pairs are the only possible combinations that the Jaccard Similarity will be calculated so as to actually identify if they share similarity at least or above 50%. The LSH recommended similar pairs of users will be tested as regard as they exact Jaccards Similarity Index and the pairs with exact index value above 50% will be retained as true positives pairs that LSH method conducted. We will report the number of true pairs returned (true positives) and the number of similarity evaluations performed that correspond to the number of similar pairs the LSH method proposed as similar. The experiment will be repeated five times with different hash functions, and the averages of the true positives and similarity evaluations will be reported.\n",

    "Finally, based on the reported results, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using LSH compared to directly comparing users based on their true representations sets.\n",

After computing the min-hash signature for a user, the signature list is appended to the `min_hash_signatures` list and finally the function returns the `min_hash_signatures` list containing the computed **min-hash signatures for all users**."

    "The purpose of this function is to prepare the data for LSH by generating min-hash signatures. LSH allows finding similar users efficiently by grouping them based on the similarity of their min-hash signatures in different bands and then assessing their true similarity using their initial representations. The task asks to perform LSH using two different instances, each with a specific number of bands and rows per band. The goal is to find pairs of users with a similarity of at least 0.5 and report the number of true positive pairs and the number of similarity evaluations performed. This process is repeated for 5 different runs using different generated hash functions.\n",

    "By using LSH and min-hash signatures, we gain efficiency in finding similar users by reducing the number of pairwise similarity evaluations. LSH allows us to narrow down the search space by focusing on users who have the same min-hash signatures in at least one band and as we learn through the lectures this significantly reduces the number of users' pairs that need to be compared for similarity evaluation. Thus, LSH provides an optimized probabilistic mechanism of finding similar users compared to directly comparing all possible users'pairs available in a dataset.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) is a technique used in data mining and similarity search to efficiently approximate similarity between high-dimensional data points. It is particularly useful for handling big datasets because it allows for scalable and efficient nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind LSH is to hash data points in such a way that similar points have a high probability of being hashed into the same or nearby hash buckets. This enables the identification of potential similar pairs by focusing on a subset of the data instead of comparing all pairs, which is computationally expensive for large datasets. LSH is particularly effective for high-dimensional data because the curse of dimensionality makes traditional distance metrics less effective. In high-dimensional spaces, the density of data points becomes sparse, and the notion of distance breaks down. LSH helps mitigate this issue by focusing on the local structure of data points rather than global distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main characteristics of hypertunning parameters of the LSH method is the number of bands and the number of rows in each band the signatures vectors will be divided to as this parameter determines the trade-off between the similarity accuracy attained and the complexity augmentation because of the increase in the possible simmilar pairs and consequently the similarity computations that are needed. By increasing 𝑏 in LSH increases recall by allowing more potential matches with lower similarity scores. By sIncreasing 𝑟 makes the match criteria stricter, leading to higher precision by restricting matches to higher similarity scores. These parameters can be adjusted to balance the trade-off between recall and precision based on the specific requirements of the application or similarity search task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our solutions:\n",
    "* *LHS Instance 1: b = 25, r = 8*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 45 similarity evaluations on average so the algorithm proposed **45** user pairs on average depending on 8 integers long tuple bands where a pair shares at least one band in common. From these evaluations about **3** pairs are identified correclty and are truly similar pairs over the 10 actual similar pairs identified form the initial set representations. The accuracy attained are rather low and this indicated that the bands and the presimilarity requirements are very strict and the pairs' selection is very stricted and limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* *LHS Instance 2: b = 40, r = 5*\n",
    "\n",
    "As the bands' number increases and the number of rows in each band decreases , the recognizable pattern among bands becomes smaller and more often identified so the similarity evaluations augments and reaches **1998** for these trial pairs the true positives identified among them reaches the **8.8** pairs on average out of the 10 actual similar pairs with similarity above the threshold set. The computational complexity is increased as the possible pairs are increased but on the other hand the accuracy and the efficiency attained is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, by using LSH in enormous datasets, we gain computational speed at the cost of some accuracy and by decreasing the b parameter (or increasing the r parameter) we save computational force at the cost of the some accuracy in the actual similarity identifications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, we need to point out that the results of our analysis heavily depend on the set seed. During the development of the current notebook, we have found out for the first LSH instance values as low as 1.6 to 3.8 and for the second one from 7.6 to 9.4. However, we choose to present a mediocre output, in order to have a more fair analysis.**"
